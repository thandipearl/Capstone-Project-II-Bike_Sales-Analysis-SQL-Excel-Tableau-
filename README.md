# Capstone-Project-II-Bike_Sales-Analysis-SQL-Excel-Tableau-

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis portfolio for a bicycle retail company. The project's primary objective was to create **interactive sales dashboards** using **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Tableau** to provide the executive team with **actionable insights** into the company's sales performance from **2016 to 2018**.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Deliverables

- **`Data Collection.sql`**: SQL script used to query the companyâ€™s relational database. It joins multiple tables to extract key data fields such as Order ID, Customer Name, Revenue, and Product Category.
  
- **`Bike_Sales_Data.xlsx`**: The raw dataset collected from SQL, stored in an Excel workbook. This file serves as the foundational source for both dashboards.
  
- **`Bike_Sales_Excel_Interactive_Dashboard.PNG`**: A screenshot of the interactive sales dashboard built in Excel. It includes PivotTables, charts, and slicers for filtering key sales metrics.
  
- **`Bike_Sales_Tableau_Interactive_Dashboard.png`**: A screenshot of the interactive Tableau dashboard, offering more advanced visuals and interactivity to explore sales performance.
  
- **`SQL-Server-Sample-Database.zip`**: A compressed sample database used for this project, allowing others to replicate the data collection and querying steps.

## Data Analysis Process

I followed a standard five-step data analysis process:

### 1. **Problem Definition**
The objective was to analyze the companyâ€™s sales performance over the 2016â€“2018 period and deliver **interactive dashboards** that executives could use for quick decision-making.

### 2. **Data Collection**
I wrote an SQL script to extract relevant data from the companyâ€™s **SQL Server database**. This included joining multiple tables to get Order ID, Revenue, Store, State, Product Category, and Customer Info.

### 3. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**
The exported data was loaded into both **Excel** and **Tableau**. After validating the dataset, I confirmed it had no missing or corrupt values and was ready for analysis.

### 4. **Data Visualization & Analysis**
- **Excel**: I used PivotTables, PivotCharts, and slicers to build a dynamic dashboard. Key metrics included total revenue, monthly trends, top-performing stores, and customer segmentation.
- **Tableau**: I created a more sophisticated dashboard featuring:
  - Parameters for **Top N analysis**
  - **Interactive filters**
  - A **summary banner** with key KPIs

### 5. **Conclusion**
The project successfully delivered two interactive dashboards that addressed the business problem. They empower management to monitor sales trends, identify top performers, and make data-driven decisions.
